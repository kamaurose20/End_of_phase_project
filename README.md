This is a leave management system that entails html,tailwind,.js and some bit of .json
-Html file contains a form with input fields for the Employee's first name, last name, email, contact number, leave type, and leave date.

-.js file listens for the form's submit event, prevents the default form submission, collects the form data, creates a new div with the employee's information, and appends it to the employee list. Finally, it resets the form for the next entry.

in js there are different functions that wewre used ie:
- .add event listener(domcontentloader)runs after the dom had been loaded
- document.getElementByid selects elements with the id selected and stores it in form of a variable.
- document.querySelector it selects elements in a class and stores them as variables.
